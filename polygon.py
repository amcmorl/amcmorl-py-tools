def convex_hull(points, graphic=False, smidgen=0.0075):
    '''Calculate subset of points that make a convex hull around points

Recursively eliminates points that lie inside two neighbouring points until only convex hull is remaining.

:Parameters:
    points : ndarray (2 x m)
        array of points for which to find hull
    graphic : bool
        use pylab to show progress?
    smidgen : float
        offset for graphic number labels
        - useful values depend on your data range

:Returns:
    hull_points : ndarray (2 x n)
        convex hull surrounding points
