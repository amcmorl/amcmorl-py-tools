<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Some time around 1993, I went for a university interview. In the
waiting room, I met another guy who was waiting for an interview,
and we got talking. He said that at school he had recently been
doing a project on buckminsterfullerene, the strange polyhedral form
of carbon in which sixty carbon atoms combine into the shape of a
truncated icosahedron. In particular, his chemistry teacher had been
speculating about why this curious shape should form, and had
conjectured that if you took 60 points on the surface of a sphere,
caused them to mutually repel (while still constrained to the
sphere's surface) and let them move to an equilibrium state, they
might naturally form into the vertices of the buckminsterfullerene
shape.

<p>
This struck me as a fun idea to play with, so when I went home I
cooked up some simulation software and gave it a try. Unfortunately,
although I was perfectly competent to write the code for the
repelling points, I didn't do so well at writing code to visualise
the result helpfully. I was left with a vague feeling that I didn't
get the buckminsterfullerene shape, but I couldn't have usefully
described what I did get.

<p>
More recently I was asked by a friend to see if I could produce a
solid with seven faces, for use as a stage prop representing a
seven-sided die. It occurred to me that an interesting way to
construct a reasonably symmetric seven-faced solid might be to do
the same trick again: constrain seven mutually repelling points to
the surface of a sphere and let them find equilibrium, but instead
of using them as the vertices of a polyhedron, draw a tangent plane
to the sphere at each point and see what polyhedron those planes
enclosed.

<p>
It's now been ten years since I originally experimented in this
area, and now I'm much better at maths, so this time I've managed to
do a proper job, and create software which can sensibly draw the
actual polyhedra obtained by these techniques. So here are some
interesting results and some pretty pictures on the web for
everybody else to enjoy.

<h2>Construction</h2>

<p>
My 1993 attempt at this problem used an extremely simple technique
to display the results. I simply projected my sphere on to a circle
on the screen, and displayed the points in two distinct forms
according to whether they were on the front or the back side. So for
60 points, it would have looked something like this:

<p align=center>
<a href="points60.png"><img src="points60.png"
alt="[307x308 greyscale PNG, 11KB]" width=307 height=308 border=0></a>

<p>
From this diagram you can observe that the points are arranged in
something like a triangular lattice, and deduce that therefore the
solid depicted is probably <em>not</em> the buckminsterfullerene
structure which is composed of pentagons and hexagons. But it's not
easy, in general, to figure out what sort of polyhedron is
represented by one of these diagrams; how about this one, with 13
points?

<p align=center>
<a href="points13.png"><img src="points13.png"
alt="[306x306 greyscale PNG, 7KB]" width=306 height=306 border=0></a>

<p>
I know <em>I</em> couldn't stare at that set of points and work out
what sort of polyhedron it would end up looking like. So I wrote
some software to do the job for me. For those who are interested,
I'll now describe the techniques I used; for everyone else, if you
skip on to the next section there will be more pretty pictures :-)

<ul>
<li>
<em>The face construction</em>: in this case we are given a set of n
points, and we must construct a polyhedron with n faces, with each
face being the tangent plane to the sphere at one of the given
points.

<p>
To do this I began by drawing each face plane separately. I rotated
the whole point set until one point was at the very top of the
sphere, and then I computed the intersection lines of every other
tangent plane with the horizontal one at the top. Then I simply
generated PostScript which drew that set of intersecting lines on a
page, so that the human viewer could easily pick out the central
polygon in the middle of the mess. It typically looked something
like this:

<p align=center>
<a href="facediagram.png"><img src="facediagram.png"
alt="[400x400 greyscale PNG, 20KB]" width=400 height=400 border=0></a>
</li>

<p>
This represents one face of the 13-sided polyhedron generated from
the above set of 13 points. Each face is numbered; the diagram shows
the number of the face at the centre, and each intersection line is
labelled with the number of the other plane involved. At the centre
of the diagram is the actual desired polygon. In principle a full
set of these diagrams should have been adequate to construct the
desired polyhedron: simply print them all out, cut out the central
polygon from each sheet, and glue them to each other in the manner
indicated by the numeric labels shown around each face.

<p>
However, this seemed like far too much work; much better to simply
generate a 3D model of the polyhedron and display it on the screen.
In order to pick out the face boundary among all those crisscrossing
lines, I notionally expanded a circle out from the centre point of
the face until it touched a line. Then I knew that point on that
line was part of the face boundary; so I then moved along that line
until I encountered a crossing point with another line, then turned
left on to <em>that</em> line and did the same thing again, and so
on until I returned to where I'd started. This allowed me to end up
with a clear definition of each polygonal face, and then I simply
reversed the rotation which had brought one point to the top in
order to put that face back in its proper place. Repeat for every
point, and we have a model:

<p align=center>
<a href="faces13.png"><img src="faces13.png"
alt="[271x277 greyscale PNG, 11KB]" width=271 height=277 border=0></a>

</li>
<li>
<em>The vertex construction</em>: in this case we are given a set of
n points, and we want to find a convex polyhedron with those points
as vertices. In other words, what we actually want is the <em>convex
hull</em> of those points: the smallest convex shape containing them.

<p>
Finding convex hulls is a common topic in algorithms textbooks, and
I'm sure there are highly efficient algorithms to do it very quickly
and efficiently; but I knew the precise format of the output I
wanted, I didn't know whether any existing algorithms would be
easily adapted to produce that output even once I'd researched them,
and in any case I thought it would be fun to figure it out for
myself. So what I did was: for each <em>pair</em> of vertices, I
rotated the sphere so that that pair was aligned along a vertical
line, then I projected the whole point set into the horizontal plane
so that my two points were mapped on to a single one. Then I sorted
all the other points into order of angle from the fulcrum point, so
that they were in the order you'd see them if you stood at the
fulcrum and turned around slowly. Finally I examined that list of
angles to see if there was a gap of size pi or greater; if so, that
implied that a line could be drawn through my fulcrum point in such
a way that all the other points were on the same side of it. In
other words, this told me whether my fulcrum point was on the convex
hull of the projected point set, which (returning to three
dimensions) would be true if and only if the line between the two
original points was part of the 3D convex hull.

<p>
This gave me the precise set of <em>edges</em> of the polyhedron I
wanted. Now all I needed was to assemble those edges into faces. So
you take an edge, you walk along it to a vertex, you look at all the
other edges leaving that vertex, and you pick the one that allows
you to turn left by the sharpest amount. Repeat until you get back
to where you started, and you've circumnavigated a face. So once
again we have now generated a 3D polyhedron model, in precisely the
same form as the last one:

</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>
So, having written all this code, I then applied it to various
numbers of points and produced some actual results.

<p>
Some obvious results you might expect to see would be the five
Platonic solids. Some of these do in fact work the way you'd expect;
applying the vertex construction to 4, 6 and 12 points does create a
tetrahedron, an octahedron and an icosahedron:

<p align=center>
<a href="vertices4.png"><img src="vertices4.png"
alt="[232x202 greyscale PNG, 5KB]" width=232 height=202 border=0></a>
<a href="vertices6.png"><img src="vertices6.png"
alt="[228x253 greyscale PNG, 8KB]" width=228 height=253 border=0></a>
<a href="vertices12.png"><img src="vertices12.png"
alt="[264x277 greyscale PNG, 13KB]" width=264 height=277 border=0></a>

<p>
And, of course, applying the face construction instead generates
their duals. The tetrahedron's dual is another tetrahedron (not very
interesting), but the other two generate a cube and a dodecahedron:

<p align=center>
<a href="faces4.png"><img src="faces4.png"
alt="[211x215 greyscale PNG, 5KB]" width=211 height=215 border=0></a>
<a href="faces6.png"><img src="faces6.png"
alt="[248x252 greyscale PNG, 7KB]" width=248 height=252 border=0></a>
<a href="faces12.png"><img src="faces12.png"
alt="[272x264 greyscale PNG, 10KB]" width=272 height=264 border=0></a>

<p>
Where it gets interesting is that although doing the face
construction on six points produces a cube, doing the vertex
construction on eight <em>doesn't</em>. Instead we get a more
interesting solid:

<p align=center>
<a href="vertices8.png"><img src="vertices8.png"
alt="[245x236 greyscale PNG, 8KB]" width=245 height=236 border=0></a>

<p>
What's happened here is that instead of the points arranging
themselves at the corners of a cube, they have "discovered" that by
twisting one end of the cube 45 degrees relative to the other one,
they can end up slightly further apart. So instead of a cube, we end
up with a square <em>antiprism</em>: a square at each end, four
triangles connecting edges of the top square to corners of the
bottom one, and four more triangles connecting edges of the bottom
square to corners of the top one.

<p>
This phenomenon illustrates what seems to be a general principle of
the vertex construction: faces bigger than a triangle appear not to
be stable. A square face, for example, will buckle into two
triangles wherever it can; pentagons and hexagons are unheard of.
(The two square faces at the ends of the solid shown above are
actually the <em>only</em> case, in all of the examples I tried, in
which a non-triangular face appears at all.)

<p>
So this is why the vertex construction cheerfully produced a
tetrahedron, an octahedron and an icosahedron: they're the three
platonic solids which are made of nice stable triangles. The cube
doesn't work because it's made of squares, and so we would expect
the dodecahedron not to work either. And, indeed, when we apply the
vertex construction to 20 points, we get this:

<p align=center>
<a href="vertices20.png"><img src="vertices20.png"
alt="[280x285 greyscale PNG, 17KB]" width=280 height=285 border=0></a>

<p>
Far from a nice clean dodecahedron with twelve large flat pentagonal
faces, we instead see a complete mess: an irregular solid composed
of 36 triangles. And in fact this continues to be the case for
larger and larger numbers of points. In particular, applying the
vertex construction to 60 points gives a solid which is nothing at
all like the truncated icosahedron structure of buckminsterfullerene:

<p align=center>
<a href="vertices60.png"><img src="vertices60.png"
alt="[281x282 greyscale PNG, 26KB]" width=281 height=282 border=0></a>

<p>
With its structure composed of rigid triangles, in fact, it seems to
me that this solid is actually rather <em>more</em> reminiscent of
Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome structures than the molecule
named after him is!

<p>
But that's enough of vertices. These vast expanses of triangles get
quite boring after a while; you get some much more
attractive-looking solids from the <em>face</em> construction, using
each of the source points as the centre of a polyhedron face.

<p>
One of the initial motivations for this work was to find a
reasonably symmetric seven-sided polyhedron. So given all this, it
was the work of a moment to construct a point set of size 7, apply
the face construction, and produce ...

<p align=center>
<a href="faces7.png"><img src="faces7.png"
alt="[260x276 greyscale PNG, 7KB]" width=260 height=276 border=0></a>

<p>
... a total disappointment! There are apparently no
<em>interesting</em> solids with seven faces; instead all we get is
a terribly boring pentagonal prism.

<p>
Some slightly larger numbers give some more interesting results.
Here are the solids with 9, 10 and 11 faces:

<p align=center>
<a href="faces9.png"><img src="faces9.png"
alt="[269x259 greyscale PNG, 8KB]" width=269 height=259 border=0></a>
<a href="faces10.png"><img src="faces10.png"
alt="[264x281 greyscale PNG, 9KB]" width=264 height=281 border=0></a>
<a href="faces11.png"><img src="faces11.png"
alt="[228x246 greyscale PNG, 9KB]" width=228 height=246 border=0></a>

<p>
The 9-face solid is quite pretty in particular, I think. It's most
easily visualised by imagining two tetrahedra glued together by one
face, then squashed down into a fairly flat dipyramid. Then this
dipyramid has been truncated at each of the three sharpest corners
to produce a solid with six pentagons and three rhombi.

<p>
Finally, one last curiosity. I have shown above that sixty points on
a sphere do not naturally converge into the vertices of the
buckminsterfullerene truncated icosahedron. However, if we apply the
<em>face</em> construction to 32 points, we get this:

<p align=center>
<a href="faces32.png"><img src="faces32.png"
alt="[284x285 greyscale PNG, 17KB]" width=284 height=285 border=0></a>

<p>
This <em>is</em> the truncated icosahedron! Or something very close
to it, anyway. The hexagons on this solid are not quite regular;
this is because of the constraint that all the faces of a solid
created in this way have to be tangent to the same inscribed sphere.
This is not true of the regular truncated icosahedron, in which the
perpendicular distance from a face to the centre is different for
the pentagonal and hexagonal faces. So although this solid is
totally unstable in terms of vertices and nothing even close to it
is generated by the vertex construction, it does turn out to be a
natural choice for the face construction.

<h2>Downloads</h2>

<p>
Here you can download the source code for all the software I used to
generate these pictures, and also a program which generates nets for
constructing of all the above polyhedra out of cardboard.

<p>
My own code is written in basic core
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>,
so it should run
equally happily on Linux or Unix, Windows, or any other operating
system which can run Python. (I've only tested it on Linux.) I did
all the linear algebra myself the old-fashioned way without using
any Python extensions, so these programs should run happily on any
Python installation at all.

<p>
In addition to Python, you might need some other software to make
sense of the results:

<ul>
<li>
All graphical output is done in PostScript, so you will need some
means of interpreting PostScript files. If you have a PostScript
laser printer, that should be adequate. If not,
<a href="http://ghostscript.com/">Ghostscript</a>
is a software PostScript implementation which can output to most
printers, many bitmap image file formats, and even PDF.
<li>
If you want to reproduce my example files in the same way I did, I
provide Makefiles designed to work with
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">GNU make</a>.
<li>
The archive also contains this web page and its supporting images.
If you want to regenerate the exact images yourself, the Makefile
which produces them requires Ghostscript (see above), the
<code>pnmcrop</code> program from the
<a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/">Netpbm</a>
package, and the <code>convert</code> program from the
<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a>
package.
</ul>

<p>
Here is the archive itself, in Unix <code>.tar.gz</code> format:
<a href="polyhedra.tar.gz">polyhedra.tar.gz</a>
