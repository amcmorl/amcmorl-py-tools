# Python code to find the crossing point of two lines.

# This function is optimised for big-integer or FP arithmetic: it
# multiplies up to find two big numbers, and then divides them. So
# if you use it on integers it will give the most accurate answer
# it possibly can within integers, but might overflow if you don't
# use longs. I haven't carefully analysed the FP properties, but I
# can't see it going _too_ far wrong.
#
# Of course there's no reason you can't feed it rationals if you
# happen to have a Rational class. It only does adds, subtracts,
# multiplies, divides and tests of equality on its arguments, so
# any data type supporting those would be fine.

    #     ya1 + dya (x - xa1) / dxa = yb1 + dyb (x - xb1) / dxb
